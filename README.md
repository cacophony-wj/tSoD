 The Sleep of Death - A Fallout 3 Modlist for Wabbajack

# This is two guides

I began with the Fallout 3 STEP guide "Clear and Present Danger" from [Kelmych] available [here](https://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3). I removed mods I found to be problematic, such as "20th century weapons" with its nightmare of patches and "RobCo Certified" with compatibility problems. I also took out a couple things not to my taste. Can't remember what, sorry. There were a few remaining items that were left untextured, so for those I filled in details and highlights from the "Fallout 3 Overhaul Guide" available [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/23468). All credit goes to those authors, all I did was create an automated installation blending those two approaches. Please don't bother anyone on STEP or the Nexus about this abortion, I'll handle any and all questions because it's my responsibility.

# Known problems

Experience gains are too high. You'll jump 40XP discovering Springvale just outside the Vault which will bump you halfway to level 3 since you'll already be level 2 from Vault 101's bullshit. I know nothing about how to correct this yet. Also, Project Beauty seems to be a rather inconsistent mod. Caucasian heads on African bodies, pasty white faces, the list goes on. I have tried all the solutions shitty search engines will give me but have yet to find a satisfactory answer other than removing the mod. I thought to remove the body replacers too but all the armors fit those meshes and have the weird black bars on chests problem if you deactivate them. Don't message me about neck seams. I don't want to hear it unless you have an answer for it. Also the body replacers are nude, and there might be some adult stuff in downloads that I haven't gotten around to deleting yet. It's poorly made, tame and not installed so it might not have even compiled with it.

# No GFF

I have no game folder files folder yet. So you'll have to get FOSE at the very least. The GOG version of Fallout 3 should "just work" but the Steam version will require a little more voodoo. You'll need an old SDK version of xlive.dll copied to the game folder to start with. I hear there's a version on the Nexus but the one I found was on DLL-Files.com. :sweatboy: Just be sure to get the SDK DLL ONLY. Trying to install Games For Windows Live via any of the "official" methods in this day and age will possibly make you more angry than when Microsoft made you do it the first time. I know it did me! Oh and you'll also need the 4GB patch and the manual tick fix change like in VNV, as well as the Games for Windows Live Disabler from the Nexus. That's all I can remember but if it still won't launch please let me know. Some of this stuff might be in the downloads folder for you if it compiled but I have no way of knowing that.

# Password

It's passworded for now. Message me for the password. Mysterious rituals will determine if I can give it to you.
