#CHANGELOG

### 0.0.6

I configured every esp and esm in the LO to be locked in position. Hopefully this will prevent it from reverting to an alphabetical listing.

### 0.0.5

- I think I have the Application Load Error problem sorted out by now. Added some steps to the readme for potential future troubleshooting.
- Removed HD Robots Retexture as it is on Mediafire (which is a bitch
- Replaced Mothership Zeta HD with Mothership Zeta Lowres because the HD is on Yandisk (??????)
- Cleaned up the downloads folder of a few mods that aren't actually in the list.
- Removed a couple of optional ESPs that wouldn't compile because of the above.

### 0.0.4

Generated FaceGen data in the CK for all NPCs. This seems to have fixed the albino faces but made noticeable texture glitches on the male bodies much more apparent. I will consider removing Robert's since I doubt many people want to see that anyway.

### 0.0.3

The failure of Hi-Rez Vault Doors to install should be fixed.

### 0.0.2

First public release. Compiled game folder files.

### 0.0.1

Extremely early alpha release. Password-protected, this file has been removed.
