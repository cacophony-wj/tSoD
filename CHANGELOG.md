#CHANGELOG

### 0.0.4

Generated FaceGen data in the CK for all NPCs. This seems to have fixed the albino faces but made noticeable texture glitches on the male bodies much more apparent. I will consider removing Robert's since I doubt many people want to see that anyway.

### 0.0.3

The failure of Hi-Rez Vault Doors to install should be fixed.

### 0.0.2

First public release. Compiled game folder files.

### 0.0.1

Extremely early alpha release. Password-protected, this file has been removed.
